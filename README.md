 
# Pytorch implementation of CellSpliceNet: Interpretable Multimodal Modeling of Alternative Splicing Across Neurons in *C. elegans*
We introduce CellSpliceNet, an interpretable transformer-based multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict splicing outcomes across the neurons of C. elegans. By integrating four complementary data modalities, namely long-range genomic sequence, local regions of interest (ROIs) in the RNA sequence, secondary structure, and gene expression, CellSpliceNet captures the complex interplay of factors that influence splicing decisions within the cellular context. CellSpliceNet employs modality-specific transformer embeddings, incorporating structural representations guided by mutual information and scattering graph embeddings. To this end, a novel and carefully designed multimodal multi-head attention mechanism preserves the integrity of each modality while facilitating selective cross-modal interactions, notably allowing gene expression data to inform sequence and structural predictions. Attention-based pooling within each modality highlights biologically critical elements, such as canonical intronâ€“exon splice boundaries and accessible single-stranded RNA loop structures within the exon.
